# Cocktail Help

This website mostly showcases design features.

## Bootstrap

Using 3 features from Bootstrap frawork.

1 - Carosele - spins black and white images in the background for website ambiance
2 - Collapse - which redirects the user to shop for the items discribe. An on  mouse function pops up the image
3 - Card - holds recipes of cocktail

I tweaked and ajusted many of the parameters of framework elemenst to build the current site dynamic.

## HTML

Heave on the elements due to frequent implementation of Bootstrap.
Imported goodle fonts. 

## CSS

Implementing Flex Display Property. 
Changed dymics based on the screan size.
Some postion variations for the "bar tool' pop up.

## jacaScript

Using it to run the 'mouseover' function.
